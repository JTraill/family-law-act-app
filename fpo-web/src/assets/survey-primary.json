Everything you say must be true to the best of your knowledge.  You can include information that you got from someone else, but you must include who told you, when they told you and that you believe what they said is true. You do not need to use any special wording but it is important that you are clear and provide as much detail as possible, including:\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>the date the incident occurred</li>\n<li>a description of the incident of family violence</li>\n<li>who was involved (including any witnesses or the police)</li>\n<li>the child(ren)'s involvement in the incident, if applicable</li>\n<li>any injuries or trauma from the incident</li>\n<li>any other detail about the incident you feel it is important for the court to know</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\nNote:  If there is a police report, medical report or doctor's note, or any photographs related to the incident, you must talk about them in this section and attach them as exhibits.  To include something as an exhibit, you must talk about it and state that it is attached as an exhibit.  Each exhibit gets a letter assigned to it, starting with 'A' and continuing through the alphabet.  For example, the police report attached as Exhibit A."
